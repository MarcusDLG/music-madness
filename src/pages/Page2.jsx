      <h2>Latest Album</h2>
      <p>
        Their latest album Red Gold Green 3 was written and produced in Miami at
        Green's Mom's house, while the recording was done in the D.C. area where
        the band is originally from. RGG 3 continues the band's saga of
        go-go/rap/rock music that compels the listener to dance. At the same
        time, RDGLDGRN also introduced a hard-rock element on this album that
        was popular with the fans!
