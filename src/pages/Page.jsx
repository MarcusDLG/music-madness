        tracks of the album, "Prologue" and "The Dark Sentencer", on YouTube.
        The track listing and album artwork were released on June 22, 2018 after
        days of teasers depicting fragments of the art. The band released the
        song "Unheavenly Creatures", which is the album's third track, on June
        28. On August 16, "The Gutter" was released and on September 27, "Old
        Flames" was released. The music of The Unheavenly Creatures has been
        described by music critics as progressive rock and progressive metal,
        noting many songs spanning influences such as punk rock, pop rock, and
        indie rock.
