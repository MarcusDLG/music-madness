        "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" is the debut studio album by
        American singer and songwriter Billie Eilish. It was released on March
        29, 2019, by Darkroom and Interscope Records in the US and Polydor
        Records in the UK. Eilish largely co-wrote the album with her brother
        Finneas O'Connell, who produced its music at his small bedroom studio in
        Highland Park, Los Angeles. Musically, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do
        We Go? has been characterized as a pop, electropop, avant-pop, and art
        pop album, though it also features influences from hip hop and
        industrial music. Its songs explore themes such as modern youth, drug
        addiction, heartbreak, suicide, and mental health, with lyrical
        sensibilities of humor and horror. Eilish said the album was inspired in
        part by lucid dreaming and night terrors, which are reflected on the
        cover photo.
